## I'm Youwei Zhen.
Aspiring Computer Science and Entrepreneurship student.

Over the years, I have learned many different skills and frameworks in web and software design. With those skills that I have acquired, I founded and created several tech organizations.

As of lately, I am currently developing and studying machine learning and Artificial Intelligence. I am also in the Gold Divison (Silver Medal) of USACO

When I am not grinding out my projects, you can often find me on the fencing piste ðŸ¤º.
